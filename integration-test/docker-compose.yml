  # === Overview: the product under test ===
  #
  # It would normally be bad form to test the ":latest" version of each project.
  # But here, our integration tests are different. We assume you just ran
  # ./docker/build, which _wrote_ these ":latest" versions.
  #
  # ./docker/build is complex, which is why we don't just use "build:" clauses
  # in this file.
  #
  # To make `run-in-docker-compose` work:
  # 1. ./docker/build
  # 2. ./integration-test/run-in-docker-compose
  # ... and read output from ./integration-test/reports
