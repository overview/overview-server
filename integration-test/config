# Configuration for integration tests

# docker-compose project name. Associated volumes and networks will be
# destroyed at the start and end of any call to `run-in-docker-compose`.
#
# You probably don't need to change the default: everybody _expects_ the
# default project to be destroyed frequently.
DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=overviewintegrationtester

# project name when _not_ using docker-compose. overview-integration-tester
# will not destroy this; they will use it when calling `run` and
# `run-browser`.
#
# The default, "overviewserver", is what you get when you run `./dev` after
# `git clone https://github.com/overview/overview-server.git`.
#
# Another sensible name here would be "overviewlocal". Decide your project's
# development process early: it's a pain for every developer when you change.
DEVELOPMENT_PROJECT_NAME=overviewserver

# Docker container version. We use semantic versioning; only the major version
# matters, but you can be paranoid and add minor and patch versions, too.
OVERVIEW_INTEGRATION_TESTER_VERSION=2.0.0

# Stall `run` and `run-in-docker-compose` on startup until these URLs are
# available.
#
# This is useful because docker-compose starts everything simultaneously. It
# also alerts the user when the environment is misconfigured.
