  <h2>Overview reads your documents and sorts them by topic</h2>
  Whether you are a journalist starting with thousands of pages of government documents, or a social media analyst starting with 100,000 posts, Overview will organize your documents into topics and sub-topics, and then visualize them -- so you can decide what to read, instantly count the number of documents in each topic, or tag entire topics for further work. It's like your own personal librarian.

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>It takes just a few minutes to start exploring your documents in Overview. For quick start, see this video (you'll want to watch it full screen.)</p>

  <p><strong>There are two ways to get your documents into Overview: import a DocumentCloud project, or upload a CSV file.</strong></p>

  <br /><p><strong>1. If you are a journalist, put your documents in a DocumentCloud project.</strong><br />

  <a href="https://documentcloud.org">DocumentCloud</a> is a free tool for journalists to upload, OCR, search, store, and publish their documents. If you are a journalist and you don't already have a DocumentCloud account, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/contact">here&#8217;s how to get one</a>.</p>

  <p>Log in to your DocumentCloud account and create a project to store all of your files, using the &#8220;New Project&#8221; button. Then select &#8220;New Documents.&#8221; Now here&#8217;s the trick to batch uploads: when the file dialog box opens, you can select all of the documents in a folder simultaneously by clicking on the first, then shift-clicking on the last (or pressing Control-A on Windows, or Command-A on Mac). You can keep the documents private if you like.</li>

  Then log into Overview and import your project. From the main screen, select &#8220;Import a new document set&#8221; and then &#8220;Your DocumentCloud account&#8221; and enter your DocumentCloud username and password when prompted. Your DocumentCloud projects will appear. Select the project that you want to explore, and get a coffee while Overview imports and analyzes it.</p>
  
  <br /><p><strong>2. You can also upload your documents as a CSV file.</strong><br />
  This is the best option if you're not a journalist, or if you already have your documents in that format. The CSV file must have a column named "text" with the full text of each document, one document per row. You can also add a "URL" column to tell Overview how to display the document when you view it inside the application -- this works particularly well with tweets.</p> 

  <p>To upload your CSV, log into Overview and select &#8220;Import a new document set&#8221; and then &#8220;a file you upload&#8221;. Choose the file, check the preview to make sure you have selected the correct character encoding, and go.</p>

  <br /><p><strong>3. Explore the documents in the tree view</strong></p>
  <p>Overview&#8217;s main screen is divided into four parts: the folder tree, the tag list, the document list, and the document viewer.</p>
  <figure><img src="@routes.Assets.at("images/Help/step3.png")" alt="" /></figure>
  <p>You can navigate through the folders in the tree with the arrow keys, or by clicking. When you select a folder, the documents in that folder appear in the document list. Each document in the list is summarized by a list of keywords specific to that document. Clicking on a document on the list loads it in the document viewer.</p>
  <p>You can pan the tree left and right by dragging with the mouse, or moving the scroll bar. You can zoom into the tree by using the mouse wheel, swiping two fingers on the trackpad, or dragging one end of the scroll bar. Folders which have a small ⊕ in the center can be expanded to show sub-folders, while ⊖ hides sub-folders.</p>
  <p>Each folder is labelled by the keywords that best describe the documents filed under that folder. A folder's sub-folders contain, collectively, all of the documents in that folder, broken down into more specialized groupings.</p>
  
  <br /><p><strong>4. Tag interesting documents</strong><br />
  As you explore the folder tree, you&#8217;ll run across individual documents or entire folders you want to remember. Enter a descriptive tag in the &#8220;new tag&#8221; field and press &#8220;tag.&#8221; The currently selected documents will be tagged, and a little tag color swatch will appear next to them in the document list.</p>
  <figure><img src="@routes.Assets.at("images/Help/step4.png")" alt="" /></figure>
  <p>Tags and folders have independent lives: each document can have any number of tags applied to it, and the same tag can be applied anywhere in the tree.<p>
  <p>Once you&#8217;ve created a tag, you can add the currently selected documents to it at any time by pressing the + button that appears when your mouse is over the tag name.  (To tag an entire folder at once, select the folder and then press the +/- button.) Or press &#8211; to remove the tag.</p>
  <p>Clicking on a tag name selects that tag,  highlighting the tagged documents in the tree and loading them into the document list.</p>
  
  <br /><p><strong>5. Work your way through the tree</strong><br />
  When you have a lot of documents, it pays to be systematic. We recommend working your way through the folders in the tree from left to right &#8212; biggest folders to smallest folders. Select a folder, then view a few of the documents in it to see if you understand what they have in common. If there seems to be more than one important topic in the documents in that folder, try opening up the child folders instead, until you find a folder where all of the documents are more or less the same. Then, tag that folder with a descriptive label.</p>
  <p>As you proceed, you may find documents that talk about similar topics in different folders. Overview doesn&#8217;t know what story you are working on, so it can&#8217;t always guess how the documents should be arranged. You can apply a tag to any combination of folders and documents to create a set that is meaningful to you.</p>
  <p>You may also discover that the documents in a folder are irrelevant to your story, in which case you can tag them with &#8220;read&#8221; and simply move on. Part of the power of Overview is being able to decide <em>not</em> to look at an entire folder.</p>
  <p>When you&#8217;re finished this process, you&#8217;ll have a neatly categorized tree, and a set of tags corresponding to all the interesting topics in your documents.</p>
