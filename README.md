Overview lets you search and understand your documents.

It will bulk-ingest many document formats such as Office documents, PDFs,
plain-text files and email archives. You can organize your uploads into
Document Sets.

Overview provides search, visualization, analysis and collaboration tools.
And it also supports an ecosystem of "plugins" that give new ways to look
at your files.

Overview is designed for investigative journalism, legal analyses,
e-discovery and text-heavy research projects.

Try Overview
============

* Use Overview's cloud service for free on [the public Overview
  website](https://www.overviewdocs.com).
* Install Overview [on your own
  computer](https://github.com/overview/overview-local). This is great if you
  have spotty Internet connectivity -- or if you're staying off the Internet
  (on an "airgapped" computer) to keep your documents private.
* Read more [documentation](http://help.overviewdocs.com).
* Peruse [News
  stories](https://github.com/overview/overview-server/wiki/News-stories)
  researched with Overview

Compared to others
------------------

Got documents? Maybe we're the right tool; maybe we aren't. Here's how
we compare to the other services vying for your attention.

* Windows, Mac OS and Linux have built-in tools that let you search a folder
  full of PDFs. Overview's interface lets you read the same files faster. It
  also converts images and Office documents to PDF.
* [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), Microsoft Office and Adobe
  DocumentCloud you search documents (and they can even [convert images to
  text](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/176692?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en),
  like Overview). But Overview is far, far faster at flipping between documents.
* [DocumentCloud.org](https://www.documentcloud.org/) is perfect for publishing
  documents on news websites. It also has rudimentary search tools. Overview
  has more advanced search features, and it's faster at flipping through
  hundreds, thousands or millions of documents.
